### Limitations

* The extension is deeply tied to the inner workings of [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com), meaning that 
  significant changes on their side could (temporarily) break it. If that happens, you can either:
  
    * wait for me to fix it (you can
      [open an issue](https://github.com/blmage/memrise-word-bank-dnd/issues/new) if there is none yet about it),
      
    * if you're a developer, try to fix it yourself, then
      [open a related PR](https://github.com/blmage/memrise-word-bank-dnd/compare).

### Userscript

The extension is also available as a userscript.

If you're using [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/),
[TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or
[ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), click on 
[this link](https://github.com/blmage/memrise-word-bank-dnd/raw/master/userscript/MemriseWordBankDnd.user.js) 
to install it!
